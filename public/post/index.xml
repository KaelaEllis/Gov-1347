This semester I am taking Gov 1347: Election Analytics taught by Professor Ryan Enos, which has led to the creation of this blog. In this blog post, I will analyze a district’s election and why it deviated from the forecasts.
Back in September, I chose to track the congressional election in Colorado’s 8th district.</description>
